Files:
==========
*All the files I submitted, asm.cpp and claims.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

I uploaded the outputs of three testcases as proofs for working of my assembler. They are max(3 output files), adding(3 output files) and errorhandling(3 output files) . Test cases are tested and they are working well.

*Both of my C++ programs did not show any errors or warnings when I compiled them with g++ -pedantic and g++ -pedantic -W -Wall -Wpointer-arith -Wwrite-strings standard.

*The program is compilable with g++ assembler.cpp -o asm.


=============================
Program format and structure:
=============================
1. The assembler:

	EXECUTION FORMAT: ./asm.exe filename.asm

    1.It has two containers to store labels and a mnemonic table with expected operands, respectively.
    2.  detects label errors.
    3. Correct formatting with sensible program structure. 
  

=============================
Testing:
=============================

1. The assembler:

I have tested three examples shown below. The errors only occurred in the file errorhandling.asm and 
the program immediately stopped on the second pass. 

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced three output files, a listing file, 
error log file and machine-readable object file for each example. 

1)
#Input: asm max.asm
#Output: 
a. max.l 
b. max.log (without any error messages)
c. max.o

2)
#Input:asm errorhandling.asm
#Output: 
a. errorhandling.l 
b.  errorhandling.log (without error messages shown as below but also in the log file)
c.  errorhandling.o

Error messages:
